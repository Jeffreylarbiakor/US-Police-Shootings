## DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
In this project, a multi-level exploratory data analysis is used to estimate the state-level probabilities of being shot by police as compared to the race of a suspect, his or her age, and status as being armed or unarmed. As the data become more complete and further analysis is done, this analysis can be extended to estimate a more accurate risk of being shot by police within the United States of America. The main objective of this exploratory research is to identify the correlation between the US police shootings against race, ethnicity and gender within the dataset provided.

The dataset explored is a subset of the fatal shooting database published by the Washington Post, which contains records by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The main objectives of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to maximize insight into the database structure, to detect outliers and anomalies, as well as to visualize potential relationships between the different variables (Komorowski et al., 2016).

## Description of Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains a total of 4895 rows – victims of the U.S. police shootings from 1st January, 2015 to 15th June, 2020 and a total of 15 columns which represent the attributes of each shooting incidence. The features recorded for each victim is described below:
1.	Id: A unique number given to each victim
2.	Name: The name of each victim
3.	Date: The date each victim was killed
4.	Manner_of_death: How each victim was killed
5.	Armed: Was the victim armed? If so, what were they armed with?
6.	Age: The age of each victim
7.	Gender: The gender of each victim
8.	Race: The ethnicity or race of each victim
9.	City: Which city the killing occurred in
10.	State: Which state the victim was killed
11.	Signs_of_mental_illness: True or False if the victim showed or did not show any signs of mental illness
12.	Threat_level: The police officer’s description of the response of the victim when the incidence occurred
13.	Flee: Did the victim attempt to flee from the scene?
14.	Body_camera: Did the police officer have his body camera on or was it absent?
15.	Arms_category: What category of arms did the armed victim belong to? 

## Insights
An extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the US Police shootings recorded that a total of 4895 people have been shot and killed by police since 1st June, 2020. It is not far-fetched to say that most of the victims of police killing in the U.S are male as it consists of approximately 95% of the total data recorded. Also, the age of the victims were fairly normally distributed with a long tail and the age group within 20-40 years having the highest number of occurrences.

Surprisingly, more ‘White’ people were killed as compared to ‘Black’ people, clearly indicating that further analysis should be considered in order to consider the ‘white’ and ‘black’ populations of the shootings. With over 50% of the total victims being armed wither with a firearm or a knife, more than 75% of the victims did not attempt to flee from the sight of the police upon their encounter. The statistics of the dataset could keep going on and on, however the rate of killings from 2nd January, 2015 have remained somewhat steady till 31st December, 2019. As the dataset records are not up till the end of 2020, a good rate of shootings will not be analysed with its inclusion.

With most victims being young male between the ages of 20 and 40 years, the future generation of the United States of America is to be questioned and investigated. Why are they killed more often? Are they engaging in activities which allow them to encounter the police more often? The analyses performed on this dataset hasn’t been exhausted and more work could be done on it.


## Conclusion
In a nutshell, there were a total of 4895 shootings, out of which over 80% of incidents were unfilmed. One hundred and thirty-eight people neither had a weapon nor posed any threat yet California recorded the highest number of shootings.
